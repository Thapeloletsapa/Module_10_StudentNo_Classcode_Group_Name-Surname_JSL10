# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. I navigated through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that required  debugging and using correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

#### Debugging Task

1. **Used the Correct ID in the event listener for Room 1.**

2. **Used the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**

3. **Added the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**

4. **Corrected the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**

5. **Ensured asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**

6. **Adjusted the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**

7. **Fixed the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**

8. **Added the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**
